# Life Science Project
[life-science-2021.herokuapp.com](https://life-science-2021.herokuapp.com/)

The Life Science Project is an online protocol resource for life scientists.

The goal is to provide a tool for life scientists to search for existing protocols, create and collaborate on new ones,
and share results with other scientists on the platform.

## Protocol Database

The tool provides a rich* set of existing protocols split into categories for easier navigation. The search engine
provides fast configurable search by keyword, making protocols easy to find.

## New Protocols

The platform lets you create new methods and protocols, as well as modify existing ones. Add new protocols using the
method builder with Markdown support*, and pass moderation to publish your work. Propose changes to improve other
methods or add additional information.

## Moderation

Before being published, all content must pass moderation. Request reviews, receive feedback, become a moderator to
support the platform.

## Profile

Visit your profile page to update personal information, view saved protocols and personal work. View other people's
profiles to see their publishings.
